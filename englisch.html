            This is a multiplayer version of the famous battleship game. A
            user has to sign up to play a game. Security is provided by
            Spring. Being logged in a user can either create a new game or
            join a game created by a different player. At the beginning of a
            game, the user has to place his ships by dragging and dropping
            them on a 10×10 grid area. Then the first round of firing salvoes
            begins. In each round both players can select five cells where
            they suppose the opponent’s ships to be. After every salvo, the
            user can see whether or not they scored a hit. The server only
            sends the game information (JSON) to the frontend, which the
            player is allowed to see. A game is won if one player hits all the
            ships of the opponent. A game ends in a tie if both player hit
            each others' ships in the same round. After a game ends, each
            player gets a score, which is stored in a database. Spring also
            manages database access and connectivity. Players can see their
            total score and the number of games they lost, won or tied in a
            leaderboard table on the homepage. Even if a player knows
            JavaScript and tries to circumvent the frontend game logic
            mechanisms, forbidden requests are blocked by the server. The UI
            was created paying special attention to error prevention and
            keeping the user informed about game status and next steps at all
            times.

            <h2>Find a psychotherapist</h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            At first glance, this website looks similar to the below shown
            website for Barbara Seidl. However, it is a more complex
            version of the latter by offering a search feature for therapists
            and a contact form built with a third party service called
            Email.js. On the page where users can search for therapists they
            have the possibility to enter their
            address and search for therapists, who are nearby. This is made
            possible through the use of The Google Maps Distance Matrix API.
            Users can also set filters for the type of therapy they want and
            therefore customize the results to their needs. Since Barbara Seidl (my mum)
            currently does not want either functionality on her page, you will
            not find these on there.

            This Single Page Application built with Firebase and the Vue CLI
            has user authentication and a chat in real time. I did a more
            simple version during my time at coding bootcamp. It was part of
            the curriculum. Recently i have rebuild it. I took advantage of
            Vuetify's beautiful material design and Vuex - Vue's state
            management pattern - to make the app not only look, but also feel
            good to use. The client is a soccer club that wants to have an
            app, in order for their members to be able to communicate with
            each other, see upcoming matches and have access to this
            information from their phones. Using the chat requires the user to
            be logged in. All other pages can be accessed as a guest. Feel
            free to signup and test out the chat. Tip: After opening it in
            chrome just switch the device mode to a mobile device of your
            choice. I did not test the site for other browsers, so please use
            Chrome.

          <p>
            TGIF stands for Transparency in American Government. The goal of
            the site is to make aggregated data about American Congressmen and
            Senators available to the public. While the design is simple, the
            site offers valuable information through the use of filters and
            statistics presented in tables. There are two versions of this on
            my github. One done with Vanilla Javascript and the other one with
            the help of Vue.js. The site is fully responsive.

            Cirsten Ullrich is a successful psychotherapist practicing in the city center of munich.
            She wanted a simple, clear webpresence for herself, with the possibilty of adding more content in the
            future. Together we developed a concept and a design, which i then implemented in the building phase.
            Photos and text were provided by the customer.

              through the whole process.
              I felt really taken care of by Isabel. She is incredibly competent, reliable and friendly. I am more than

          <p>
            This is a website i made for my mum, who runs her own practice as
            a psychotherapist. After attending a Vue.js meeting, where i
            received an introduction to Nuxt.js, i felt the urge to use Nuxt
            in my current project to experience the capabilities of this
            framework firsthand. It comes with three different 'rendering
            modes'. The option 'Server Side Rendered (Universal)' offers great
            advantages over a traditional Vue SPA. Webpages are intitially
            rendered on the fly by the server, resulting in a faster load time
            and better SEO. Ultimately, 'Universal mode' unites the best from
            both worlds. Users still get to experience the snappy UI known
            from traditional SPAs. After the inital render by the server, JS
            is responsible for loading the content based on the user's
            navigation.

          <p>
            This page could be the frontend of a simple bookstore. It is one
            of my earliest projects. Users can search for book titles and can
            flip the front cover to receive more information about the book.
            There is also a button on the back that opens a slide-show. The
            site is fully responsive. It is built with Vue.js and Bootstrap.
            Please use Chrome or Firefox to open this page.
